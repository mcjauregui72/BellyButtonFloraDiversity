This project builds an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Steps taken:
Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object on the page.
Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
Create a gauge chart that displays the individual's weekly wash frequency.
Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
Update all the plots when a new sample is selected.
